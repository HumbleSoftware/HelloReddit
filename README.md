# HelloReddit

## About 

HelloReddit is a BlackBerry Reddit application written as a personal project by a friend and I in the fall of 2009.

It is written in Java using the BlackBerry SDK (version 4.5.0) and consists of more than 4,000 lines of code.  Use it to learn about BlackBerry programming or contribute to build a better app.

# This project is up for adoption; I do not maintain this.
